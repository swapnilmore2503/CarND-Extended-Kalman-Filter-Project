Udacity CarND Term 2, Project 1 - Extended Kalman Filters

## **Project Basics**

In this project, I used C++ to write a program taking in radar and lidar data to track position using Extended Kalman Filters.

The code will make a prediction based on the sensor measurement and then update the expected position. See files in the &#39;src&#39; folder for the primary C++ files making up this project.

## **Build instructions**

Assuming you have &#39;cmake&#39; and &#39;make&#39; already:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
3. Compile: cmake .. &amp;&amp; make
4. Run it: ./ExtendedKF
